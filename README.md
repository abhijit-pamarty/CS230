Pade operator - the pade operator model
Autoencoder MBGD - the final version of the autoencoder model
diffusion solver - the code that is used to generate the dataset
If you want to run the pade-AE model - first run the diffusion solver, then run the autoencoder, then finally run the pade operator. Use process_data to take a look at the errors for each of your models.
